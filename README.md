# RefoodFCUL
University project about refreshing Refood website. Full stack development.<br>
We used HTML, BOOTSTRAP, CSS, SCSS and JS in the front end and SQL, PHP and AJAX in the back end.

# Front end
The website has a page witch everyone can access; there, it's possible to know more about the concept and also the developers.
Once you signed up (as a volunteer or institution) you can log in, and then you go to the main page.
There's an admin page only available for people that know a specific password and email, the administrators.

# Back end
We created a SQL data base and used MySql to upload some tables.
We have implemented with PHP:
- Login/Sign up system (we used PHP and HTML for the form validation);
- Update profile and select/update preferences;
- Search bar system for the users and admins;
- Statistics and more info in the admin page;
- Possibilty for volunteers to evaluate institutions from 0-5 stars;
- Also with PHP and AJAX a dynamic live chat was implemented.
